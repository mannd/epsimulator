Requirements:

Qt-4 compiled with sound support
for sound, Network Audio Sound (nas)
Qt-4 must be compiled with Qt-3 support, which is the default.

Qt is a cross-platform development framework, but so far the program has only
been tested on Linux.

Step-by-step installion:

After downloading the open source edition of Qt-4, unpack the source code and
cd into the Qt-4 directory:

    tar xfz qt-x11-opensource-src-4.X.Y.tar.gz
    cd qt-x11-opensource-src-4.X.Y.tar.gz

where X and Y are the particular version numbers of Qt-4 (e.g. 4.4.0).

Configure, make and make install Qt:

    ./configure -system-has-sound
    make
    sudo make install

This will install into the directory /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.X.Y/

Now create a soft link to this directory:

    sudo ln -s /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.X.Y/ /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4

This will allow the scripts in the bin directory to work regardless of the
version of Qt-4 that is installed.  If you upgrade your Qt-4 version, delete
the link and then create it again, linking to the new version.

Now unpack epsimulator, e.g.

    tar xfz epsimulator-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz
    cd epsimulator-vX.Y.Z/

Run qmake, using this script:

    bin/qmakeepsimulator

Then make the program:

    make

You can build the documentation using:

    bin/builddocs

The shared libraries are installed locally, so you can run the program and the
testing suite using these scripts:

    bin/runepsimulator
    bin/runtestepsimulator

If you do a "sudo make install" you can run the program the usual way:

    bin/epsimulator
    bin/testepsimulator

Finally,

    bin/erasedata

can be used to erase data and configuration files for testing.  In a final
version of the program, you would not want to erase your data!
