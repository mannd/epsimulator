Note to developers:

As EP Simulator uses shared libraries, make sure the epsimulator/lib path is included in your library path.  You can export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=[path to]/epsimulator/lib or set up a link in /usr/lib to the libraries in epsimulator/lib.  If the program is installed, this is not a problem.  If you are using KDevelop the project file will generate a command line that works, though you will probably need to change the absolute path to the program.

Here is the command line generated when I run the program (all one line):

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib:../lib:../../lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH /home/mannd/dev/local/epsimulator/bin/epsimulator

Note that there is a space between the 2nd LD_LIBRARY_PATH and the executable path (/home/mannd/dev/...etc).

You can use the shell scripts in the bin directory to build and run the
program, provided you alter the paths according to your setup.

Note that Qt4 (currently using 4.4.0) is required to compile, and Qt must be
compiled with NAS sound support:

./configure -system-nas-sound

Note that by default sound is not enabled when compiling Qt.
