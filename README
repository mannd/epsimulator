Note to developers:

    As EP Simulator uses shared libraries, make sure the epsimulator/lib path is included in your library path.  You can export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=[path to]/epsimulator/lib or set up a link in /usr/lib to the libraries in epsimulator/lib.  If the program is installed, this is not a problem.  If you are using KDevelop the project file will generate a command line that works, though you will probably need to change the absolute path to the program.

Here is the command line generated when I run the program (all one line):

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib:../lib:../../lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH /home/mannd/dev/local/epsimulator/bin/epsimulator
