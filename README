Note to developers:

You can use the shell scripts in the bin directory to build and run the
program, provided you alter the paths according to your setup.  In order for
the shell scripts to work, you must run them from the top-level directory that you
installed the source code into, e.g.:

user@Sluggo:~> cd ~/epsimulator
user@Sluggo:~/epsimulator> bin/qmakeepsimulator

Note that Qt4 (currently using 4.4.0) is required to compile, and Qt must be
compiled with NAS sound support:

user@Sluggo:~> ./configure -system-nas-sound

Note that by default sound is not enabled when compiling Qt.
