Note to developers:

EP Simulator is now set up to run via Qt Creator.  Just open the
epsimulator.pro file inside Qt Creator.  Once the program is compiled,
you can run it using the shell program epsimulator.sh located in the
bin directory in Linux, or just be double-clicking the epsimulator.exe
program in the bin directory in Windows (but first make sure the Qt
libraries are in your PATH environment variable).
