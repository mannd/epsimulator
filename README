Note to developers:

You can use the shell scripts in the bin directory to build and run the
program, provided you first add a link to your Qt-4 installion as follows:

    sudo ln -s /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.X.Y /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4

The shell scripts are:

	qmakeepsimulator
	runtestepsimulator
	runepsimulator

Note that Qt4 is required to compile, and Qt must be compiled with NAS sound
support:

    ./configure -system-nas-sound

(by default sound is not enabled when compiling Qt).

More detailed installation instructions are in the INSTALL file.
