* Prucka window management implementation
** Major behavior to emulate
   - outer borders of the central widget are not moveable.
   - windows can't be moved inside central window by dragging title
     bar.
   - Resizing windows acts like a splitter bar.
** Other behavior
   - Log window always expands to full width of central widget
   - Odd window location selection behavior
     - when new window is selected in menu, horizontal or vertical
       line is shown on screen, left mouse click opens window in
       quadrant selected.
   - Closing window expands other horizontally aligned windows
   - Uncertain if can open Review2 without Review1 and vice versa
   - Can't close Real-time
     - but no Realtime if review study or no acquisition
       - no acquisition case is handled by Navigator
       - if acquisition changed during study, no effect
	 - maybe should disable that option during study???
** UI implementation of behavior
   Simplest way to implement is via menu options.  Examples:
   - Disable Review2 if no Review1
   -
