Developer notes

Problem with ui.h file.  Adding code to Form::Init() did nothing.  I had to add a new slot to the form called init(), and this was added to the end of the constructor of the Form in the generated Form.cpp file.  I still needed to have the Form::Init() function in the ui.h file.

Ok, in KDevelop, add a public slot called init().  When asked for
implementation class for the dialog, hit cancel.  This will create the
Form.ui.h file.  Everything seems to work ok now.

Source code formatting

Will stick to Bruce Eckel convention of starting brace always at end of line.
indent with spaces 4 spaces.
Header files go from most specific to general as in Eckel.
Will use the get and set convention for member functions.
     Note it is possible to avoid get, for example:

Class Fruit {
      public:
            Fruit(string banana);
	    void setBanana(string banana);
	    string banana();
      private:
	    string banana_;
}

Actually I have now changed to the above style.

private variables will end in underscore.
enums, consts and defines will be all caps.
Typedefs will be capitalized.
