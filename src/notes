Developer notes

Problem with ui.h file.  Adding code to Form::Init() did nothing.  I had to add a new slot to the form called init(), and this was added to the end of the constructor of the Form in the generated Form.cpp file.  I still needed to have the Form::Init() function in the ui.h file.

Ok, in KDevelop, add a public slot called init().  When asked for
implementation class for the dialog, hit cancel.  This will create the
Form.ui.h file.  Everything seems to work ok now.

Source code formatting

Will stick to Bruce Eckel convention of starting brace always at end of line.
indent with spaces 4 spaces.
Header files go from most specific to general as in Eckel.
Will use the get and set convention for member functions.
     Note it is possible to avoid get, for example:

Class Fruit {
      public:
            Fruit(string banana);
	    void setBanana(string banana);
	    string banana();
      private:
	    string banana_;
}

Actually I have now changed to the above style.

private variables will end in underscore.
//enums, consts and defines will be all caps.
enums, consts and typedefs will be UpperCamelCase
defines will be all caps with underscores


Unit Testing
For now will use cxxtest.  Run ./maketests from epsimulator/src to generate the runner program.  Edit maketests to add dependencies, and MyTestSuite.h contains the tests.  The tests HAVE to be in the src directory to compile, and so tests are not a subproject.  Need to make the test suite into a make file, using a different makefile name than Makefile, e.g. maketests and invoke as make -fmaketests, e.g.  Could make a link to this named maketests to keep everything the same.

Unique identifier for each study
A key for each study can be constructed by
lastName+"_"+firstName+"_"+date/time.  Use this for the file name of the data
files and use this to locate the study data in the studieslist (? Make this a
map between the key and the data?)

Use QString QDateTime::toString(const QString& format) const to generate the
date time of the study.  This format string should work:


dd.MM.yyyy.hh.mm.ss

? add millisecs: zzz

Thus the map could be: QString key: Study study.

I need to be able to generate the key from the QListView (note QListView has
full name and formatted date time as strings, so not easy to change format back).

Can use QListView::hideColumn(int column) along with setResizeEnabled(FALSE,
column) to have hidden list view columns.  The hidden column can contain the
map key.

FIX FOR CXXTEST PROBLEM

Merely including ALL the *.o files needed all Qt-specific tests to compile.  That is, to test PatientDialog, must include in linked files patientdialog.o, moc_patientdialog.o, patientdialogbase.o and moc_patientdialog.o.  (Actually maybe the non-moc ones are needed -- will test: no all the above mentioned files are needed.)

MORE FORMATTING WOES
    Objects in .ui files are actually public data members; therefore should not end in _.  Menu items, etc. are private and should end in _.
